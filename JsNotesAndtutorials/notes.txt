1. Introduction to DOM

DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents an HTML document as a tree of objects.
It allows JavaScript to access, modify, add, and delete HTML elements dynamically.

👉 Every HTML element becomes a node (object) in the DOM.

2. DOM Tree Structure

The document is represented in a hierarchical tree structure

Each HTML tag is a node

Nodes are related as parent, child, and sibling

Example hierarchy:

Document

HTML

Head

Body

h1

p

div

3. Purpose of DOM Manipulation

DOM manipulation is used to:

Change content dynamically

Modify styles

Handle user interactions

Create interactive web pages

Update UI without reloading the page

4. Accessing DOM Elements

JavaScript provides methods to select elements from the DOM.

Common Methods:

getElementById() → selects element by ID

getElementsByClassName() → selects by class

getElementsByTagName() → selects by tag

querySelector() → selects first matching CSS selector

querySelectorAll() → selects all matching elements

5. Reading and Changing Content

DOM allows modification of element content.

textContent → changes only text

innerText → visible text only

innerHTML → changes HTML content (can include tags)

⚠️ innerHTML can cause security issues if misused.

6. Manipulating Attributes

Attributes of elements can be:

Read

Modified

Removed

Common operations:

Get attribute value

Set new attribute value

Remove an attribute

7. Styling Elements Using DOM
Inline Styling

Styles can be changed using .style property

Example: color, background, font size

Using CSS Classes (Recommended)

Add class

Remove class

Toggle class

Check if class exists

This approach is cleaner and more maintainable.

8. Creating and Adding Elements

DOM allows creation of new elements dynamically.

Steps:

Create an element

Add content to it

Insert it into the DOM

Common insertion methods:

Append at end

Insert before another element

9. Removing Elements

Elements can be removed from the DOM:

Remove a specific child

Remove an element directly

Used for deleting items, clearing lists, etc.

10. DOM Events

Events are actions performed by the user.

Common Events:

click

submit

change

keydown

mouseover

Events allow JavaScript to respond to user actions.

11. Event Handling

Event handling is done using:

Event listeners

Advantages:

Multiple events on same element

Cleaner code

Separation of HTML and JavaScript

12. Event Object

When an event occurs, JavaScript creates an event object that contains:

Target element

Event type

Mouse or keyboard information

13. Event Bubbling and Capturing

Bubbling: Event flows from child → parent

Capturing: Event flows from parent → child

By default, events use bubbling.

14. Prevent Default Behavior

Some elements have default actions (form submit, link navigation).

JavaScript can stop this behavior using:

Prevent default method

15. DOM Traversal

Traversal means moving through DOM elements.

Types:

Parent access

Child access

Sibling access

Used to navigate between related elements.

16. DOM vs BOM
DOM	BOM
Controls HTML document	Controls browser
Uses document object	Uses window object
Page manipulation	Browser features
17. Advantages of DOM Manipulation

Dynamic content update

Interactive user experience

No page reload required

Better performance

18. Common Mistakes

Overusing innerHTML

Manipulating DOM repeatedly inside loops

Not waiting for DOM to load

Inline event handlers

19. Best Practices

Use querySelector

Modify classes instead of inline styles

Use event delegation

Keep JavaScript separate from HTML

20. Exam-Ready Definition

DOM Manipulation is the process of dynamically accessing, modifying, creating, or deleting HTML elements using JavaScript.




🔑 Why do we need innerText, textContent, and innerHTML?
Short core answer

They exist because we sometimes need only text, sometimes visible text, and sometimes HTML structure.

One property cannot safely handle all cases.

1️⃣ innerHTML — when you need HTML structure
Purpose

Read or write HTML markup

Create elements dynamically

Example
div.innerHTML = "<b>Hello</b>";

Result

👉 Text becomes bold

Why needed?

To insert tags (<b>, <p>, <span>)

To build UI dynamically

⚠️ Risk:

Can inject malicious HTML (XSS)

2️⃣ textContent — when you need raw text (fast & safe)
Purpose

Work with pure text only

Ignore styling and visibility

Example
div.textContent = "<b>Hello</b>";

Result

👉 Displays literally: <b>Hello</b>

Why needed?

Security (prevents HTML injection)

Better performance

Reads hidden text too

✔ Preferred for:

User input

Data rendering

Security-sensitive apps

3️⃣ innerText — when you need visible text only
Purpose

Read/write what the user actually sees

Example
div.innerText = "Hello";

Special behavior:

Respects CSS (display: none)

Triggers reflow (slower)

Why needed?

UI-based logic

Screen-visible text checks

🧠 Key Differences (Why one cannot replace all)
Feature	innerHTML	textContent	innerText
Parses HTML	✅	❌	❌
Returns hidden text	✅	✅	❌
Respects CSS	❌	❌	✅
Safe from XSS	❌	✅	✅
Performance	Medium	Fastest	Slow
Creates elements	✅	❌	❌
🎯 Real-world Use Cases
🔹 Use innerHTML when:

Building components dynamically

You trust the content

🔹 Use textContent when:

Showing user data

Avoiding security issues

Performance matters

🔹 Use innerText when:

Checking what is visible

UI testing

Accessibility logic

⚠️ Why not just use innerHTML everywhere?

Because:

❌ Security risks

❌ Performance cost

❌ Accidental HTML execution
